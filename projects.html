				<i class="fab fa-snapchat"></i>
				 
                  <H4>Q&amp;A’s are very helpful with snapchat as it is not as formal as using email. It sparks a
                  better connection between the teacher and student, therefore the student may be
                  able to take in the information given to them easier.</H4>
                  <h4>Another useful tool that snapchat has is the ability to create group chats for
                  homework, useful links, notes, etc. What’s even better is the group call tool, this may
                  not work as well with a large group but with a smaller group of students</h4>
